# In-browser review — 2026-06

**Purpose:** systematic click-through of the dz-dashboard SPA against the real Phase 1 DB to
surface data gaps, honesty-affordance violations, and UX/presentation bugs.

**Method — observe-only.** This session records findings; it does **not** fix code, run the
gate, or touch CI. Fixes are deferred to a small number of batched fix-passes downstream
(see "Proposed fix passes"), each its own PLAN→BUILD→VERIFY thread with a single gate + CI
run. This batching is deliberate: it prevents the piecemeal refactor/test/lint/CI churn that
makes on-the-spot fixing expensive.

**Triage shortcut (don't deep-read source):** to pin a finding's layer, hit the BFF directly
(`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8800/v1/...`) and compare the JSON to the screen.
- Wrong/absent in the API response → `data` / `analytics` / `api-contract`.
- Correct in API but wrong on screen → `frontend-presentation`.
- Bare `0` / dash where data is absent → `gap-affordance` (must be `DataGap`).

-->

### F-01 — Home curation: wrong components surfaced (data shown is accurate)
- View/route: `/` (home)
- Observed: Home currently surfaces — "scored era (10 years)" stat, a 2025-leader callout,
  and "power model top movers". All values render **accurately**; the complaint is *what* is
  chosen for the front door, not correctness.
- Expected: Re-curate home around season-relevant, seasonally-aware modules.
  - **Drop:** scored-era / "10 years" stat; 2025-leader callout (redundant — implied by the
    2025 champion); power-model top-movers (power-ranking system is suspected — poorly
    explained, possibly not durable; see related power-view finding).
  - **Add (always):** full-season standings; expanded records list (more record categories
    than today's home shows).
  - **Add (off-season, current date is off-season):** completed playoff bracket from last
    season; top-scoring players from the past year; recent-activity feed.
  - **Add (in-season):** this week's matchups; top-scoring players this week; recent-activity
    feed (transactions are tracked **in-season only** → feed is quiet/empty in off-season).
  - Implies a **season-phase signal** (in-season vs off-season) to switch the layout.
- Severity: major
- Layer: frontend-presentation (composition/curation); a recent-activity/transactions feed
  and last-season playoff bracket may need backend support — confirm endpoints exist in a
  later pass.
- Evidence: product judgment from walkthrough; `/v1/meta` confirms off-season context today
  (scored 2016–2025, `availability_current_season_only:true`). Data accuracy not in dispute.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/home/` (HomePage composition); season-phase helper TBD.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-02 — Standings timeline tooltip + color polish
- View/route: standings → timeline chart (`/v1/seasons/{id}/standings/timeline`)
- Observed: Timeline renders and is a genuinely good insight, but the tooltip (a) shows a bare
  week number, (b) lists owners in a **fixed/stable order** regardless of the hovered week, and
  (c) the line palette **repeats colors** across the 12 teams.
- Expected: (a) label "Week N"; (b) order owners by **their rank in that week** (so the tooltip
  reads as that week's standing); (c) 12 visually distinct colors, one per team.
- Severity: minor (polish)
- Layer: frontend-presentation
- Evidence: visual walkthrough; timeline endpoint returns per-week ranks, so rank-ordering the
  tooltip is a presentation change only.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/standings/` (timeline chart component + tooltip).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-03 — Standings: room for one more insight module
- View/route: standings page
- Observed: Page has the table + timeline; feels like it has headroom for one more "cool insight".
- Expected: Add a second analytical module (model to propose + implement — e.g. luck/expected-wins,
  points-for vs. finish, longest streaks). Open-ended; decide in the fix-pass plan.
- Severity: polish (enhancement)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (may need a small analytics helper depending on the chosen insight)
- Evidence: product judgment.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/standings/`; possible `analytics/standings.py` helper.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-04 — Completed season should show playoff placements
- View/route: standings page (completed seasons)
- Observed: For a completed season, standings show regular-season rank but not the end-of-year
  **playoff finish** (champion, runner-up, 3rd, …) as a first-class element.
- Expected: Surface playoff placements/badges (champion, 2nd, etc.) when the season is complete.
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation — **data already present**: standings rows carry `final_rank`
  and `/v1/seasons` carries `champion`; this is rendering, not new analytics.
- Evidence: `curl /v1/seasons/2/standings` → every row has `final_rank`; `/v1/seasons` →
  `champion:{...}` per season.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/standings/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-05 — Manager → roster not reachable from Managers panel
- View/route: `/managers` (index) → manager click-through
- Observed: From the Managers panel you can't reach a manager's roster. Expected to land on
  the **most recent season's ending roster** when clicking through.
- Expected: Clicking a manager surfaces (or links to) their latest-season ending roster.
- Severity: major
- Layer: frontend-presentation (linking) — **data exists** at `/v1/teams/{team_id}/roster`,
  but it's keyed by **team_id**, while owner profiles (`/v1/owners/{owner_id}`) expose only
  seasons/trajectory/head-to-head. Needs an owner→(latest-season team_id) hop then the team
  roster endpoint. Couples to F-06 (owner vs team identity).
- Evidence: OpenAPI — roster routes are all `/v1/teams/{team_id}/*`; no owner roster route.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/managers/` (profile/index linking) + owner→team map.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-06 — Owner-vs-team identity model gap (DEFERRED — needs ownership-history research)
- View/route: `/managers` (index) — conceptual, affects multiple views
- Observed: League has always had **12 teams**, but **ownership has changed hands** over 16
  seasons. So league history has **>12 distinct owners**, while the same 12 team identities
  persist. Consequence: all 12 *teams* have 16 seasons (so "16 seasons" is **not** an
  insightful per-manager stat), but **owners** have varying tenures.
- Expected: A team-vs-owner identity model that distinguishes the persistent team line from
  its succession of owners, so per-manager stats reflect true owner tenure (not the team's).
  **Cannot be modeled now** — requires user research into the actual ownership-succession
  history. Flag as expected and prepare the schema/affordances for it.
- Severity: major (deferred / blocked on external research)
- Layer: data / analytics (identity model) — surfaces in managers, standings, records, rivalries.
- Evidence: product/domain knowledge from the league owner; `/v1/owners` vs `/v1/teams`
  currently treat owner and team as near-equivalent.
- Suspected location: identity mapping spanning `ff_pipeline` data + `analytics/owners.py`;
  needs an ownership-history source first.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-07 — Managers index sort is one-directional
- View/route: `/managers` (index)
- Observed: Column sorting only sorts one direction; can't toggle ascending/descending.
- Expected: Click toggles asc ↔ desc (standard table sort).
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation
- Evidence: visual walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/managers/` (index table sort handler).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-08 — Trophy case display is awkward
- View/route: manager profile → trophy case
- Observed: Trophy-case layout reads awkwardly.
- Expected: A cleaner presentation (model to try alternatives and pick).
- Severity: polish
- Layer: frontend-presentation
- Evidence: visual walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/managers/` (profile trophy-case component).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-09 — Manager profile: room for one more insight module
- View/route: manager profile
- Observed: Trajectory + rivalry snapshot are well-received "cool insights"; page has headroom
  for one more. (Pattern to learn from for new insight ideas: rank-trajectory over time,
  pairwise rivalry richness — analytical, comparative, time-aware.)
- Expected: Add one more analytical module (model to propose + implement).
- Severity: polish (enhancement)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (+ possible small analytics helper)
- Evidence: product judgment.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/managers/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-10 — Season table doesn't show a result/finish for all seasons
- View/route: manager profile → season table
- Observed: Table is accurate (incl. 2010–2015) but does not show a **result/finish** for every
  season; it should be present for all completed seasons.
- Expected: A per-season result (playoff finish / champion / made-playoffs) on every completed row.
- Severity: minor
- Layer: data / analytics — `/v1/owners/{id}/seasons` returns `made_playoffs: null` for **all**
  rows, while `final_rank` + `is_champion` are populated. So if "result" = playoff outcome, the
  `made_playoffs` signal is uncomputed (data/analytics); if final-rank-derived, it's a frontend
  render. Fix-pass to pick the source.
- Evidence: `curl /v1/owners/5/seasons` → every row `made_playoffs:null`, `final_rank` present.
  Also: `team_id` differs each season for one owner (17→29→41→53→65→77→89…) — corroborates F-06.
- Suspected location: `analytics/owners.py` (season list / `made_playoffs`) and/or
  `web/src/features/managers/` season table.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-11 — Rivalry snapshot "24g" label is unclear
- View/route: manager profile → rivalry snapshot
- Observed: Games-played renders as e.g. "24g", which reads as "24 grams" not "24 games".
- Expected: Clearer label (e.g. "24 GP", "24 games") and better styling.
- Severity: minor (polish)
- Layer: frontend-presentation
- Evidence: visual walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/managers/` (rivalry-snapshot component).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-12 — Enrich rivalry snapshot (cumulative +/-, closest game, biggest blowout w/ links)
- View/route: manager profile → rivalry snapshot
- Observed: Snapshot under-surfaces data the head-to-head endpoint already provides, and is
  missing two desired metrics.
- Expected: Show — total cumulative +/- points vs that owner across all meetings; **closest
  game** and **biggest blowout** scores, each linking to that matchup's box-score page.
- Severity: minor (enhancement)
- Layer: split —
  - **biggest blowout + link: already in API** → `most_lopsided_meeting{margin_for_a,matchup_id}`;
    pure frontend (surface + deep-link to `/seasons/{id}/weeks/{wk}/matchups`).
  - **closest game (smallest margin): NOT in API** → analytics addition to head-to-head.
  - **cumulative +/- points: NOT in API** (only `avg_margin_for_a`) → analytics addition.
- Evidence: `curl /v1/owners/5/head-to-head/1` → has `avg_margin_for_a`,
  `highest_scoring_meeting{matchup_id}`, `most_lopsided_meeting{matchup_id}`; no closest-game,
  no cumulative total.
- Suspected location: `analytics/head_to_head.py` (+ schema) and
  `web/src/features/managers/` rivalry snapshot.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-13 — Add a close-game flag (mirror the blowout flag)
- View/route: matchups → week grid
- Observed: Blowout flag is a liked insight; there's no symmetric **close-game** flag.
- Expected: A close-game flag for small-margin matchups.
- Severity: minor (enhancement)
- Layer: analytics (threshold) + frontend — `margin` is already in the matchups payload;
  prefer the close/blowout threshold live backend (no metric math in web), mirroring blowout.
- Evidence: `curl /v1/seasons/4/weeks/6/matchups` → each game has `margin`.
- Suspected location: `analytics/matchups.py` (flag) + `web/src/features/matchups/` grid.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-14 — Color the matchup margin +/- per side (green/red)
- View/route: matchups → week grid
- Observed: Margin isn't color-coded per side.
- Expected: Render each side's +/- margin in green (winner) / red (loser).
- Severity: polish
- Layer: frontend-presentation (`margin`/`is_winner` already in payload).
- Evidence: matchups payload has `margin`, `is_winner`, `winner_team_id`.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/matchups/` grid card.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-15 — Week stepper should allow direct week selection
- View/route: matchups → week-stepper (also applies to standings week-stepper)
- Observed: Stepper only steps ±1; no way to jump directly to a week.
- Expected: Dropdown or a clickable list of all week numbers (1–17; 16 in older seasons).
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation
- Evidence: visual walkthrough.
- Suspected location: shared week-stepper component under `web/src/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-16 — Unscored-era "incomplete" flag over-claims at the matchup grid
- View/route: matchups → week grid, 2010–2015 (probed 2012 wk6)
- Observed: 2012 wk6 team scores + margins are **full and accurate**, yet the era still carries
  an "incomplete/unscored" affordance (season `is_scored:false`). The honesty layer is firing a
  false negative — labeling correct, complete grid data as incomplete. User believes the flag is
  stale (not 100% confirmed; depends on player-level box-score completeness — see box-score view).
- Expected: Grid-level results for 2010–2015 should **not** be flagged incomplete; the gap
  affordance must be scoped to the layer that's actually missing (player-level fantasy scoring),
  not the whole season. Reword: regular-season results + team totals **are** available
  2010–2015; only per-player fantasy points are absent. Decouple the affordance from blanket
  season-level `is_scored`.
- Severity: major (honesty-layer correctness — mislabels good data, erodes trust)
- Layer: gap-affordance + api-contract (`box-score` returns `reason:"season_unscored"`).
  **RESOLVED scope (DB probe):** per-player **scored** points genuinely absent 2010–2015
  (`player_stats_scored` has rows only for 2016–2025), so the box-score "Not scored" gap is
  **honest**. But team totals are real, so the grid/season-level wording over-claims. Fix is
  precision of the affordance, not surfacing hidden data.
- Evidence: `curl /v1/seasons/4/weeks/6/matchups` → `is_scored:false` yet real
  `team_a.score`/`team_b.score`/`margin`. `curl /v1/matchups/957/box-score` →
  `available:false, reason:"season_unscored", home:null`. DB (ro): `player_stats_scored`
  seasons = {2016…2025}; `player_stats_raw` seasons = {2010…2025}.
- Suspected location: season `is_scored`→affordance mapping in `web/src/features/matchups/`;
  box-score gap copy; `is_scored` wording in meta/analytics.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-17 — Show entering W/L record at matchup start
- View/route: matchups → week grid (matchup panels)
- Observed: Panels show only the game result, not each owner's W/L **entering** the game.
- Expected: Show entering record per side (e.g. 1-0 / 0-1 / 0-0-1 for a Week 2 matchup).
- Severity: minor (enhancement)
- Layer: data / analytics — **not in API**; needs an entering-record computation per matchup.
- Evidence: matchups payload carries no per-team record field.
- Suspected location: `analytics/matchups.py` (+ schema) and `web/src/features/matchups/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-18 — Box-score expandable breakdown could be more insightful (2025)
- View/route: matchups → box score (scored era) → per-player expandable breakdown
- Observed: 2025 box score is accurate; the expandable per-player breakdown is a liked insight
  but feels like it could go deeper / be cooler.
- Expected: Richer per-player breakdown (model to propose — e.g. stat-line → points derivation,
  vs-position rank that week, share of team total, start/sit value).
- Severity: polish (enhancement)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (+ possible analytics if new per-player metrics are added)
- Evidence: visual walkthrough; `player_stats_scored` + `player_stats_raw` both present for
  2016–2025, so stat-line context is available to enrich the breakdown.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/matchups/` box-score; `analytics/box_score.py` if enriched.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-19 — Record deep-links land on generic, sometimes unhelpful pages
- View/route: `/records` → per-record links
- Observed: Score/matchup records (highest/lowest team score, blowout, narrowest, highest-scoring
  matchup) link **correctly** to the matchup. But:
  - **best player week / best season** link to the generic player/owner page, not a
    record-specific destination.
  - **longest win / loss streak** link to the manager page, where the streak isn't viewable →
    unhelpful.
  - **closest rivalry** links to the pairwise rivalry page (an appropriate endpoint) but that
    page doesn't actually explain/justify the "closest" claim (couples to F-12).
- Expected: Each record links to a destination that *shows the record* — e.g. best-player-week →
  that week's box score with the player highlighted; streaks → the matchup span; closest-rivalry →
  an enriched pairwise page that surfaces the closeness metric.
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation (link targets); some destinations/anchors may not exist yet.
- Evidence: walkthrough; `/v1/records` categories listed.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/records/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-20 — Expand the records catalog (new "cool insight" records)
- View/route: `/records`
- Observed: Current categories are score/season/streak/championship oriented; many high-interest
  records are missing.
- Expected: Add records such as — player on the most owners' rosters across years; most
  added/dropped player; highest avg transactions per owner per year; most trades; best draft
  performance; (more, model to brainstorm). These are roster/transaction/draft aggregations.
- Severity: minor (enhancement; sizeable scope)
- Layer: data / analytics (new aggregations) + api-contract + frontend.
- Evidence: product judgment; `/v1/records`, `/v1/records/draft`, `/v1/records/championships`
  exist as the extension surface.
- Suspected location: `analytics/records.py` (+ schema, route) and `web/src/features/records/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-21 — Add a league-wide trophy case to the Records section
- View/route: `/records`
- Observed: No aggregate trophy case in this section.
- Expected: A league-wide trophy case with search/filter access (distinct from the per-manager
  trophy case in F-08).
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation — championship data exists at `/v1/records/championships`.
- Evidence: `/v1/records/championships` route present.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/records/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-22 — Team-level records wrongly scoped to the scored era (exclude 2010–2015)
- View/route: `/records`
- Observed: Records payload carries a `scored_era` scope and **all team-level records cite 2016+**
  (highest_team_score 2019, lowest 2022, highest_scoring_matchup 2019, best/worst season PF
  2019/2018). But team totals are **valid and present for 2010–2015** — so these records are
  computed over the wrong window. A pre-2016 game/season could be the true record.
- Expected: Team/score/season-level records range over **all seasons with team totals**
  (2010–2025). Only player-dependent records (best_player_week) stay scoped to 2016–2025.
- Severity: major (record **values may be incorrect**, not merely incomplete)
- Layer: analytics (records scoping) — separate the scored-era gate (player records) from the
  full-history gate (team/score records).
- Evidence: `/v1/records` → `scored_era` list present; every team record `season_year` ≥ 2019;
  team totals exist 2010–2015 (`/v1/seasons/4/weeks/6/matchups` had real scores). Fix-pass must
  recompute against pre-2016 team data and verify whether any pre-2016 game/season takes a record.
- Suspected location: `analytics/records.py` (era scoping per category).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-23 — Pairwise rivalry page is thin and some labels are vague
- View/route: `/rivalries` → pairwise (also the target of records' "closest rivalry" link, F-19)
- Observed: Matrix is solid. Pairwise shows all expected head-to-head values but feels thin for
  how much history exists between two owners; some labels are vague, e.g. "avg margin (for
  <owner>) X pts/game" doesn't read clearly.
- Expected: Clarify labels (e.g. "<owner> averages +14.9 pts/game in this matchup") and expand
  what's surfaced — per-season breakdown, closest game + biggest blowout (linked), cumulative
  +/- points, playoff meetings, current rivalry streak. Re-think for insight + clarity.
- Severity: minor (enhancement)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (clarity/expansion) + analytics (closest game, cumulative +/-).
  **Couples with F-12** — same `head-to-head` endpoint; enrich the analytics **once** and
  surface in both the manager-profile snapshot (F-12) and this pairwise page.
- Evidence: `/v1/owners/5/head-to-head/1` has `avg_margin_for_a`, `highest_scoring_meeting`,
  `most_lopsided_meeting` (linkable) but no closest-game / cumulative-+/- / per-season split.
- Suspected location: `analytics/head_to_head.py` (+ schema) and `web/src/features/rivalries/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-24 — Drop the `scope=all` option and the `has_scored` flag from the players UI
- View/route: `/players` index (+ contract)
- Observed: The index exposes a `scope` toggle (`league`/`all`) and a `has_scored` marker per row.
- Expected (user directive): This app is **danger-zone-league-specific**. Players never rostered
  during league tenure (2010–2026+) should **not be visible anywhere in the app** → remove the
  `scope=all` affordance entirely; league-relevance is the only mode, enforced app-wide. Also
  **drop `has_scored`** from the UI — it's uninformative (all indexed players are assumed
  league-relevant). Keep the **rostered-season span** (review accuracy in the major pass, F-25).
- Severity: major
- Layer: frontend-presentation + api-contract (remove `scope` param / `has_scored` field).
- Evidence: `/v1/players` params include `scope`; rows include `has_scored`.
- Suspected location: `api/routes/players.py` (`scope`), `analytics/players.py:list_player_index`,
  schema `PlayerIndexRow`, `web/src/features/players/PlayersPage.tsx`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-25 — Roster→player match leakage: ghost/mismatched index entries (MAJOR data pass)
- View/route: `/players` index (and any player surface)
- Observed: `A.B. Brown` (player_id 3689) is the first index entry, `scope:league`,
  `first_rostered_season:2012, last_rostered_season:2013` — but the real A.B. Brown last played
  in the NFL in **1992**, never during league tenure. This is a **roster→player ID mismatch**:
  `team_rosters` matched a real 2012–2013 roster slot to the wrong nflverse player (the documented
  abbreviated-name / stub-duplicate failure mode). The league-scope filter can't catch it because
  `team_rosters` vouches for the bad match. Likely many similar undiscovered mismatches/omissions.
- Expected: A thorough, **automated, self-informing** cleanup pass that reconciles `team_rosters`
  → player identity against the league's actual rostered history, removing ghosts and fixing
  mis-matches — **driven by the app's stated purpose** (danger-zone-specific, complete, no
  superfluous out-of-scope players), **not** granular per-case decisions by the user. Also
  re-verify rostered-span accuracy here.
- Severity: blocker (data integrity — corrupts the index, bios, and any roster-derived view)
- Layer: data (Phase-1 `team_rosters`→player matching) — surfaces through `analytics/players.py`.
- Evidence: `/v1/players?name=Brown&scope=league` → A.B. Brown rostered 2012–2013, has_scored=false;
  external fact: real A.B. Brown's last NFL season was 1992. His detail/search shows roster weeks
  **2012 wk3–16 and 2013 wk0–16** — note the suspicious **week 0** entry (likely a preseason/import
  artifact worth auditing in the same pass).
- Suspected location: Phase-1 roster→player matching (`ff_pipeline`); precedent for triage→ship:
  `docs/plans/players-audit-dashboard.md` + `docs/handoffs/players-audit-danger-zone.md`.
- Note: per CLAUDE.md, Phase-1 changes are restricted to additive read-only helpers; if the fix
  must mutate `team_rosters` matching it belongs in the **pipeline repo**, not the dashboard —
  scope that boundary explicitly in the pass's PLAN session.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-26 — Pre-2016-only rostered players present as statless (looks like an error)
- View/route: `/players` index + detail
- Observed: `Aaron Hernandez` is legitimately rostered **2010–2012** (`has_scored:false`); his entire
  tenure is in the unscored era, so he has no reconstructed fantasy points and appears statless —
  indistinguishable from a ghost/error to the user.
- Expected: Affordance that explains "rostered in the unscored era (2010–2015) — no fantasy scoring
  reconstructed", and/or surface his **raw** stat lines (which exist, see Key data fact). Never let
  a real league player read as empty/erroneous.
- Severity: minor (honesty/affordance)
- Layer: gap-affordance + frontend; raw stats exist (`player_stats_raw` covers 2010–2025).
- Evidence: `/v1/players?name=Hernandez` → rostered 2010–2012, has_scored=false.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/players/` detail empty-state; couples to F-16 / Key data fact.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-27 — Pre-2016 weekly fantasy scoring absent everywhere (cross-cutting DECISION)
- View/route: player detail scoring chart; also box scores (F-16), player-week records (F-22),
  Hernandez (F-26).
- Observed: Weekly fantasy scoring is empty for every pre-2016 season — scoring charts, box
  scores, and player-week records all blank for 2010–2015. User has repeatedly stated this "should
  be available already."
- Expected: **Reconstruct 2010–2015 fantasy scoring** — the user confirms this is the desired end
  state and it is **feasible**. Inputs all exist: nfl.com scraped league scores (definitive truth,
  the source of the existing team totals) **and** player stat lines (`player_stats_raw`, definitive).
  The reason scoring was never applied: league scoring **rules changed at several points** in
  2010–2015. Method:
  1. For each pre-2016 season, **discover that season's scoring settings** by reconciling
     `player_stats_raw` against the definitive nfl.com scores — where applying current rules drifts
     from the nfl.com truth reveals the era's rule deltas.
  2. **Confirm + log** each season's settings (a per-season scoring-rules ledger).
  3. Apply the discovered settings to produce `player_stats_scored` for 2010–2015; thereafter
     stats:scoring can be **self-validated** (raw → settings → score == nfl.com truth) without
     relying solely on the scraped scores.
  Outcome: resolves most coverage gaps and makes the coverage/About page largely obsolete. Several
  findings collapse when this lands: F-16, F-22 (player records), F-26, F-39 (draft value pre-2016).
- Severity: major (cross-cutting; this is the dashboard's strategic north star — "all league years,
  accurate scoring/players/owners")
- Layer: data — **Phase-1 / pipeline scoring reconstruction**; escalate as its own program, not a
  dashboard fix. Backed by the per-season league-settings ledger (see cross-cutting theme below).
- Evidence: DB (ro) `player_stats_scored` seasons {2016…2025}; `player_stats_raw` {2010…2025};
  team totals already present for 2010–2015 (from nfl.com scrape). Hernandez detail: bio+ownership
  render, scoring chart empty. User confirms inputs are present and reconstruction is the goal.
- Suspected location: pipeline scoring (`ff_pipeline`) + a per-season scoring-rules ledger.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-28 — Ownership timeline still too verbose
- View/route: player detail → ownership timeline
- Observed: Timeline is complete and accurate (Phase-A span collapse held) but still reads verbose.
- Expected: Collapse further into shorter, scannable info blocks.
- Severity: minor (polish)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (possibly tune span granularity in `ownership_timeline`).
- Evidence: walkthrough; `analytics/players.py:ownership_timeline` already produces spans.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/players/PlayerDetailPage.tsx` (ownership block).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-29 — Availability section: deprioritize off-season, replace with a player insight module
- View/route: player detail → availability
- Observed: Availability is empty/irrelevant in the off-season (current-season-only data).
- Expected: Deprioritize availability until in-season; for now replace it with a player-focused
  "insight" module (give it a better name than "cool insights"). Implies the same season-phase
  awareness as F-01.
- Severity: minor (enhancement; seasonal)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (+ season-phase signal shared with F-01).
- Evidence: `/v1/meta` `availability_current_season_only:true`; off-season today.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/players/PlayerDetailPage.tsx`; season-phase helper (F-01).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-30 — Stats explorer default should be season totals
- View/route: `/stats`
- Observed: Explorer supports season totals, weekly leaders, position/season/team filters, but the
  default landing isn't season totals.
- Expected: **Season totals** as the default view; top weekly scoring totals reachable as a
  navigable area from there.
- Severity: minor (IA / default)
- Layer: frontend-presentation.
- Evidence: walkthrough; `/v1/stats/season-totals` exists.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/stats/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-31 — Season totals include NFL playoff games (should be fantasy weeks only)
- View/route: `/stats` → full season player stats (season totals)
- Observed: Season totals include **NFL playoff games**, inflating totals with games outside the
  fantasy season.
- Expected: Totals scoped to the **fantasy season only (weeks 1–17)**; exclude NFL post-season /
  weeks beyond the fantasy schedule.
- Severity: major (totals are inflated / inaccurate)
- Layer: analytics (season-totals week filter).
- Evidence: user observation (authoritative on league); fix-pass to confirm week range in
  `season-totals` aggregation.
- Suspected location: `analytics/stats.py` (or wherever season-totals aggregates) — week cap.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-32 — Fantasy-phase week filters + historically-accurate season-length model (app-wide)
- View/route: `/stats` (filters); model affects standings/records/matchups app-wide
- Observed: No way to filter by fantasy phase; and the fantasy schedule **changed length over
  time** (regular season 1–13 → 1–14; playoffs 14–16 → 15–17; championship wk16 → wk17).
- Expected: Add phase filters — fantasy regular season (1–14, prev 1–13), playoffs (15/16/17,
  prev 14/15/16), championship (wk17, prev wk16). Back it with a **per-season week-structure
  model** enforced historically. **Switch year is TBD** — user will supply later; **expect and
  prepare for it**. NB: standings already reports `regular_season_weeks:14` for 2010, which may
  be historically wrong under the "prev 1–13" rule — same model must fix that.
- Severity: major (mis-classifies regular vs playoff weeks across the app)
- Layer: data / analytics (season-schedule model) + frontend filters.
- Evidence: user (authoritative); `/v1/seasons/2/standings` → `regular_season_weeks:14` for 2010.
- Suspected location: a season-schedule config/helper consumed by `analytics/` (standings,
  records, stats); `web/src/features/stats/` filters.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-33 — Pre-2016 gap affordance is stark across views (copy unification)
- View/route: `/stats` pre-2016 ("No scores / No scored data for this scope."); also box scores,
  player charts.
- Observed: The pre-2016 empty-state is honest but stark/terse and worded inconsistently across
  views.
- Expected: One warm, consistent affordance explaining the unscored era (2010–2015: results &
  team totals exist; per-player fantasy scoring not reconstructed). Apply uniformly.
- Severity: polish (gap-affordance)
- Layer: gap-affordance / frontend-presentation.
- Evidence: stats pre-2016 message; couples to F-16, F-26, F-27.
- Suspected location: shared `DataGap` copy + per-view usages.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-34 — Team page season-year selector doesn't update the page
- View/route: team page → top-right season selector
- Observed: Selecting a new year doesn't change the team page; the shown season doesn't match the
  selected year.
- Severity: major (broken control)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (selector not wired to page state / refetch).
- Evidence: walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/teams/` (season selector → page state).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-35 — Team roster-by-week shows unscored flag pre-2016 despite complete data
- View/route: team page → roster-by-week, pre-2016
- Observed: Weekly roster renders accurately for pre-2016, yet an "unscored data" flag still shows.
- Expected: No incompleteness flag where the roster data is complete (extends F-16 — affordance
  must be scoped to the missing layer, not the whole season).
- Severity: minor (honesty over-claim)
- Layer: gap-affordance (season `is_scored`→flag); see F-16.
- Evidence: walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/teams/` roster section.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-36 — Schedule's matchup deep-link is broken pre-2016
- View/route: team page → schedule → matchup link (pre-2016)
- Observed: Schedule is accurate pre & post 2016, but the linked matchup page is **broken** for
  pre-2016 games.
- Expected: Pre-2016 matchup link should land on a valid page — render the team-total result view
  (which exists) instead of erroring on the absent player-level box score (couples to F-16).
- Severity: major (broken navigation)
- Layer: frontend-presentation (link target / pre-2016 matchup page handling).
- Evidence: walkthrough; `/v1/matchups/{id}/box-score` returns `available:false` pre-2016, so the
  box-score page likely errors instead of degrading to team totals.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/matchups/` box-score route + `web/src/features/teams/` schedule link.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-37 — Transactions only shows drafted players; need full transaction history
- View/route: team page → transactions
- Observed: "Transactions" shows only players **drafted** by the team — not adds/drops/trades/
  waivers across the season.
- Expected: Full transaction history. Separate **draft** transactions into their own space; show
  **in-season** free-agent/waiver/trade activity alongside. Surface FAAB bid info where applicable
  (the league switched from standard waiver order → FAAB at a historical point — **TBD, expect it**;
  same historical-model theme as F-32). Transactions are a rich source for records (F-20) and insights.
- Severity: major (core data feature largely absent)
- Layer: data + analytics + frontend.
- **Recommended resolution (asked of model):** two-tier —
  1. **Now, dashboard-scoped:** derive add/drop/retain by diffing **`team_rosters` week-over-week**
     (player appears = added, disappears = dropped, present N weeks = retained). Read-only, no scrape,
     ships in the dashboard; gives transaction *shape* without exact dates/bids. Game-time
     game-center rosters (e.g. 2012 wk10 post-MNF finals) are the authoritative weekly snapshot to diff.
  2. **Later, pipeline-scoped:** a new **nfl.com scrape pass** to capture the real transaction log
     (exact dates, waiver vs FA vs trade, FAAB bids). This is a **Phase-1** job — escalate as its
     own decision, not a dashboard fix.
- Evidence: `/v1/teams/{id}/transactions` route exists but is draft-only per walkthrough;
  `team_rosters` is week-grained and already read-only-available.
- Suspected location: `analytics/transactions.py` (roster-diff derivation) + schema/route +
  `web/src/features/teams/`; nfl.com scrape lives in `ff_pipeline`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-38 — Draft value: expand into a robust, drillable insight space
- View/route: `/draft` → draft value
- Observed: Draft value is the **exemplar "cool insight"** — it captures the whole reason for this
  dashboard (personalized league insight nfl.com doesn't offer). Currently it's a single view.
- Expected: Click-through into steals/busts detail; sort by **position** and **round**; room to
  grow into a robust content area. Treat as the template for what a high-value insight should do.
- Severity: minor (enhancement; high product value)
- Layer: frontend-presentation + analytics (sortable/drillable draft-value).
- Evidence: `/v1/seasons/{id}/draft/value` exists.
- Suspected location: `analytics/draft.py` + `web/src/features/draft/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-39 — Draft value unavailable pre-2016 (depends on F-27 decision)
- View/route: `/draft` pre-2016 → cards read "Players not scored - value unavailable"
- Observed: Pre-2016 drafts are accurate (teams/order/picks) but have no draft-value insight
  because player scoring is absent.
- Expected: Rectify alongside the pre-2016 scoring decision (F-27) — if scored points are
  reconstructed upstream, draft value backfills automatically.
- Severity: minor (dependent on F-27)
- Layer: data (pre-2016 scoring, see F-27) → analytics draft-value.
- Evidence: walkthrough; couples to F-27 / Key data fact.
- Suspected location: `analytics/draft.py` value calc (needs scored points).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-40 — Draft board must render as a 12-column snake grid
- View/route: `/draft` → draft board
- Observed: Board isn't laid out in the standard fantasy draft-board format.
- Expected: Always 12 columns (one per drafting team), **snake order** by round — R1 picks 1–12
  L→R, R2 picks 13–24 R→L, R3 25–36 L→R, etc. (Consistent with the always-12-teams fact, F-06.)
- Severity: minor (presentation correctness for the signature draft view)
- Layer: frontend-presentation.
- Evidence: walkthrough; standard fantasy draft-board convention.
- Suspected location: `web/src/features/draft/` board component.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### Non-finding — no season is missing draft data
- Stepping 2010–2025: every season has accurate draft info (teams + order). The roadmap's
  "seasons without captured drafts" gap does not manifest in the real DB. No action.

### F-41 — Power ranking: keep, but revise methodology + verify inputs
- View/route: `/power`
- Observed: Ranking is sensible and *does* explain its method, but the method feels arbitrarily
  composed (auto-delivered, not user-informed). Earns its place as an insight but isn't highly
  compelling.
- Expected: Revise/expand the model toward something more compelling and league-informed; keep the
  on-page explanation. Also **verify the model's inputs**: confirm whether it depends on
  player-level scoring (which would compromise pre-2016, where it currently *looks* valid but is
  hard to verify) — if it's W/L + team points only, pre-2016 is sound.
- Severity: minor (enhancement)
- Layer: analytics (power model) + on-page methodology copy.
- Evidence: walkthrough; pre-2016 power renders and looks plausible but is unverified.
- Suspected location: `analytics/power.py` (+ methodology text in `web/src/features/power/`).
- Note: F-01 still stands — drop power **top-movers from the home view**; this keeps the
  **dedicated power view**, just improved.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-42 — Power timeline chart is noisy/confusing (shared with standings timeline)
- View/route: `/power` → power-over-time chart
- Observed: Rank-over-time chart is noisy and hard to read.
- Expected: Improve legibility (fewer crossing lines / better color separation / clearer hover) —
  same legibility problem as the standings timeline (F-02); both likely the **shared chart wrapper**
  (roadmap P9).
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation (shared chart component).
- Evidence: walkthrough; couples to F-02.
- Suspected location: shared chart wrapper under `web/src/`; `web/src/features/power/`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-43 — Build an automated data-gap / correctness validation harness (process)
- View/route: cross-cutting (raised at `/power`, applies app-wide)
- Observed: Manually verifying whether gaps/values are correct (esp. pre-2016) is inefficient and
  memory-dependent; the user explicitly wants an automated way to double-check gaps.
- Expected: An automated audit harness that cross-checks the app's gap affordances and computed
  values against the DB — e.g. asserts "team totals present 2010–2015", "player scoring absent
  2010–2015", "no never-rostered players in the index", "records range over the correct window".
  This would have caught F-16, F-22, F-25, F-31, F-35 mechanically.
- Severity: minor (process/tooling; high leverage)
- Layer: testing / tooling (backend; read-only DB assertions).
- Evidence: user request; mirrors the players-audit automated approach (F-25).
- Suspected location: `tests/dashboard/` (a data-integrity/coverage test module) or a small audit script.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-44 — Global search bypasses the league-scope filter (ghosts resurface)
- View/route: global search
- Observed: Search returns never-rostered players that the players index correctly excludes. A.J.
  Feeley is **absent** from `scope=league` (`/v1/players?name=Feeley&scope=league` → `[]`) but
  global search surfaces him. So search queries the full nflverse universe, not the league-relevant
  set. (Distinct from F-25: Feeley has no `team_rosters` row at all — this is a scope-leak, not a
  bad match.)
- Expected: Search applies the same league-relevance scope as the index — never-rostered players
  appear nowhere (consistent with F-24's "no out-of-scope players anywhere").
- Severity: major (re-introduces the exact ghosts the players audit removed)
- Layer: data / api-contract (search query scope).
- Evidence: `scope=league` Feeley → `[]`; `scope=all` Feeley → present, rostered seasons NULL;
  search returns him anyway.
- Suspected location: the search endpoint/query (player branch) — apply the `team_rosters`-scoped
  filter used by `list_player_index`.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-45 — Team search is weak (NFL synonyms, players-by-team, fantasy team names)
- View/route: global search → teams
- Observed: Player + owner search is excellent (incl. "mike" → manager first, then players). Team
  search falls short:
  - NFL team nomenclature inconsistent: "New York" → only Giants (not Jets); "Jets" → "Jets" not
    "New York Jets".
  - Searching an NFL team doesn't surface its current players ("MIN"/"Minnesota"/"Vikings" → no
    Vikings players).
  - Fantasy team names aren't matched: "north" misses "...King in the Northvale" / "The Northvale
    Scumbags".
- Expected: NFL team matching across city + nickname + abbreviation (synonyms); searching a team
  surfaces its players; fantasy team names are searchable.
- Severity: major (search incomplete for a whole entity class)
- Layer: data / analytics (search matching: team synonyms, player→team, fantasy-team-name index).
- Evidence: walkthrough examples above.
- Suspected location: the search endpoint/query (team + fantasy-team branches).
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-46 — Search dropdown can't scroll with many results
- View/route: global search → top-menu dropdown
- Observed: When there are many results, the dropdown can't be scrolled.
- Severity: minor
- Layer: frontend-presentation.
- Evidence: walkthrough.
- Suspected location: `web/src/` search dropdown component.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-47 — Add an automated search test suite (functional + security edge cases)
- View/route: global search (process)
- Observed: Search is only spot-checked manually; no systematic coverage.
- Expected: Automated tests — expected successes, expected failures, and **security edge cases**:
  script injection (XSS), prompt injection, uncleaned regex / special-char input. Verifies the
  search query is sanitized and the input is treated as data, not code/regex.
- Severity: minor (test/security hardening)
- Layer: testing / security (backend search + frontend input handling).
- Evidence: user request; pairs with F-43 automation theme.
- Suspected location: `tests/dashboard/` (search) + `web/` input sanitation.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### F-48 — Coverage page: DST gap undocumented; keep as dev-facing fact
- View/route: `/about` (coverage)
- Observed: Coverage page reads honestly but does **not** mention the DST gap. User: not required
  for end-users, but worth keeping for development / early-phase fact-checking.
- Expected: Record the DST status as a dev-facing note. Reconcile the conflict: `/v1/meta` claims
  `dst_scoring_complete:true`, but there's a known partial-DST concern (DST yards/sacks read low,
  rooted in nflverse team-defense upstream). Confirm which is authoritative; don't surface to
  end-users unless real.
- Severity: polish (dev documentation / data accuracy of a flag)
- Layer: data (meta flag accuracy) + docs.
- Evidence: `/v1/meta` `dst_scoring_complete:true`; known upstream DST yards/sacks gap.
- Suspected location: meta/coverage computation; dev docs.
- Batch: see assignment map under "Proposed fix passes"

### Cross-cutting theme — a per-season league-settings ledger
- Several findings depend on the same missing artifact: a **per-season record of how the league was
  configured**, because rules changed over time and aren't currently modeled:
  - **Scoring rules** changed across 2010–2015 (F-27) — needed to reconstruct pre-2016 scoring.
  - **Season/week structure** changed (regular 1–13→1–14, playoffs/championship weeks shifted) —
    app-wide (F-32); switch year TBD.
  - **Waiver system** changed standard-order → FAAB at a historical point (F-37); switch TBD.
  - **Ownership succession** — owners changed hands while the 12 teams persisted (F-06); needs
    research.
- Expected: one authoritative, per-season **league-settings ledger** (scoring, schedule, waiver
  system, ownership) — partly auto-discovered (scoring via raw↔nfl.com reconciliation, F-27),
  partly user-supplied (switch years, ownership). Many findings resolve cleanly once it exists.
- This is infrastructure, not a single view fix — call it out in the batch plan as a foundation
  several batches consume.

### Key data fact — raw vs scored coverage split (informs all gap copy)
- `player_stats_raw`: rows for **2010–2025** (every season). Raw NFL stat lines exist for the
  "unscored" era.
- `player_stats_scored`: rows for **2016–2025 only** (season_ids 1, 8–16). Per-player **fantasy
  points** were never reconstructed for 2010–2015.
- Matchup/team totals exist for 2010–2015 (stored from source export), which is why grids/
  standings are complete while box scores are not.
- Implication for fix-passes: the 2010–2015 gap is **player-level fantasy scoring only**.
  Gap copy should say exactly that. A future *reconstruction* (score the raw lines) is a
  **Phase-1 pipeline** job, out of dashboard scope — do not attempt in a dashboard fix-pass.

### Non-finding — 2010–2015 standings are complete by design (not a stale flag)
- The unscored-era probe: `/v1/seasons/2/standings` (2010) returns full `wins/losses/
  points_for/points_against` + `final_rank` for all teams, with season `is_scored:false`.
  `is_scored` flags **player-scoring reconstruction** (no per-player box scores 2010–2015),
  not standings. Standings are correct/complete for those years; the DataGap affordance
  belongs in box-score/player views, not standings. **No action** — recorded so a fix-pass
  doesn't "correct" correct behavior.

## Proposed fix passes

Precedent for triage→ship-in-passes: `docs/plans/players-audit-dashboard.md` +
`docs/handoffs/players-audit-danger-zone.md`.

**On batch count.** The ideal is 2–4 batches; this review covered the whole app and surfaced 48
findings spanning every layer, so collapsing to 4 would force mega-PRs that break the
"one coherent slice, gate once" rule. The honest grouping is **6 dashboard passes + 1 upstream
program** (the upstream items are Phase-1 / research, *not* dashboard PRs). Several passes can be
merged or resequenced at the user's discretion; dependencies are noted. Order below is dependency-
first (data/analytics foundations → analytics → views).

### Assignment map (finding → pass)

| Pass | Findings |
|------|----------|
| **P1 — Analytics correctness, scoping & enrichment** (incl. season-structure model) | F-32, F-22, F-31, F-10, F-12, F-23, F-17, F-13 |
| **P2 — Data honesty & affordance precision** | F-16, F-35, F-26, F-33, F-48, F-43 |
| **P3 — Search (scope, teams, hardening)** | F-44, F-45, F-47 |
| **P4 — Transactions (dashboard roster-diff tier)** | F-37 (tier 1) |
| **P5 — Frontend: navigation & presentation fixes** | F-34, F-36, F-05, F-24, F-07, F-15, F-46, F-14, F-11, F-40, F-30, F-04, F-28, F-02, F-42 |
| **P6 — Frontend: composition, seasonality & insight enhancements** | F-01, F-29, F-08, F-03, F-09, F-18, F-38, F-21, F-41 |
| **UP — Upstream / Phase-1 program & research** (not dashboard PRs) | F-06, F-25, F-27, F-37 (tier 2), F-49 |

---

### P1 — Analytics correctness, scoping & enrichment
- **Scope:** Fix where analytics range over the wrong window or under-surface data; build the
  per-season schedule model that the scoping fixes depend on (ship that first within the pass).
- **Findings:** F-32 (per-season week-structure model + phase filters), F-22 (team/score/season
  records range over **all** seasons with team totals, not just scored era), F-31 (season-totals
  scoped to fantasy weeks only, exclude NFL post-season), F-10 (`made_playoffs` / per-season
  result), F-12 + F-23 (head-to-head enrichment — closest game + cumulative +/-; surface
  `most_lopsided_meeting`/`highest_scoring_meeting` with matchup deep-links in both the
  manager-profile snapshot and the pairwise rivalry page), F-17 (entering W/L record per matchup),
  F-13 (close-game flag, mirror blowout).
- **Files likely touched:** `analytics/standings.py`, `analytics/records.py`, `analytics/stats.py`,
  `analytics/head_to_head.py`, `analytics/matchups.py`, a new season-schedule helper/config; route
  schemas in `api/routes/*` + `api/schemas.py`; `web/src/lib/api/` via `gen:api` (drift check).
- **Signatures (indicative):** `season_schedule(season_year) -> {regular: range, playoffs: range,
  championship: week}`; records era-gating split into `team_record_window()` vs `scored_window()`;
  `head_to_head(...)` adds `closest_meeting{matchup_id}`, `cumulative_margin_for_a`;
  `week_matchups(...)` adds `entering_record` + `is_close`.
- **Tests:** records pick a pre-2016 team game/season when it's the true max; season-totals exclude
  NFL playoff weeks (known-answer); head-to-head closest/cumulative on fixture DB; entering-record
  known answers; phase boundaries per season config.
- **Done when:** team/score/season records computed over the correct window (verified a pre-2016
  game can take a record); season totals = fantasy weeks only; head-to-head enriched + linked;
  entering record + close-game flag present; backend pytest+ruff+mypy green; gen:api drift clean.
- **Depends on:** the season-schedule model (within this pass) — and F-32's switch-years are TBD;
  build the model **config-driven** and seed known values, leave switch-years as user-supplied config.

### P2 — Data honesty & affordance precision
- **Scope:** Stop the honesty layer from over-claiming on complete 2010–2015 data; make pre-2016
  gap copy precise and consistent; add the automated gap-validation harness as the safety net.
- **Findings:** F-16 (decouple gap affordance from season-level `is_scored`; grid/standings/roster
  complete for 2010–2015), F-35 (team roster-by-week over-claim), F-26 (pre-2016-only rostered
  players present honestly, not as empty/error), F-33 (one consistent pre-2016 affordance + copy),
  F-48 (DST gap as dev-facing fact; reconcile `dst_scoring_complete` flag), F-43 (automated
  data-gap / correctness validation harness).
- **Files likely touched:** the `is_scored`→affordance mapping in `web/src/features/{matchups,
  teams,players,stats}/`, shared `DataGap` copy; possibly `is_scored` semantics in meta/analytics;
  new `tests/dashboard/test_coverage_integrity.py` (read-only DB assertions).
- **Tests (the harness itself):** asserts team totals present 2010–2015; player scoring absent
  2010–2015; no never-rostered players in the index; records range over the correct window. Would
  mechanically catch F-16/F-22/F-25/F-31/F-35.
- **Done when:** no view labels complete 2010–2015 team/roster data as incomplete; one warm,
  consistent pre-2016 affordance; harness asserts the coverage truths and is green; gate green.

### P3 — Search (scope, teams, hardening)
- **Scope:** League-scope the search; make team/fantasy-team search work; add functional + security
  tests.
- **Findings:** F-44 (apply the `team_rosters`-scoped filter to the search player branch — never-
  rostered ghosts must not surface), F-45 (NFL team synonyms city/nickname/abbrev; players-by-team;
  fantasy-team-name matching), F-47 (test suite: expected hits/misses + injection/regex/XSS edge cases).
- **Files likely touched:** the search endpoint/query (player + team + fantasy-team branches) under
  `api/routes/` + `analytics/`; `web/src/` search dropdown (scroll, F-46 is in P5); new
  `tests/dashboard/test_search.py`; input-sanitation check in `web/`.
- **Done when:** search returns only league-relevant players; team queries resolve across synonyms
  and surface players-by-team; fantasy team names searchable; injection/regex tests pass; gate green.

### P4 — Transactions (dashboard roster-diff tier)
- **Scope:** Derive in-season transaction activity from `team_rosters` week diffs; separate draft
  from in-season activity on the team page. (nfl.com scrape + FAAB → UP.)
- **Findings:** F-37 tier 1.
- **Files likely touched:** new `analytics/transactions.py` (week-over-week roster diff →
  add/drop/retain), schema + `api/routes/teams.py`, `web/src/features/teams/` transactions section.
- **Signatures:** `derive_transactions(team_id, season) -> [{week, player, action: add|drop|retain}]`.
- **Tests:** roster-diff known answers on fixture DB (added/dropped/retained spans), draft vs
  in-season separation.
- **Done when:** team page shows derived in-season activity distinct from draft picks; tests green;
  gate green. (Exact dates / waiver-vs-FA / FAAB bids deferred to UP.)

### P5 — Frontend: navigation & presentation fixes
- **Scope:** Correctness/navigation bugs and presentation fixes that don't need new analytics.
- **Findings:** F-34 (team season selector wiring), F-36 (pre-2016 matchup link → degrade to team-
  total view, not error), F-05 (manager→latest-roster link via owner→team hop), F-24 (remove
  `scope=all` + `has_scored` from the players UI/contract), F-07 (sort direction toggle), F-15
  (week selector dropdown/list), F-46 (search dropdown scroll), F-14 (margin +/- green/red), F-11
  ("24g"→clear games label), F-40 (12-column snake draft board), F-30 (stats default = season
  totals), F-04 (playoff placements on completed standings — data already present), F-28 (collapse
  ownership timeline further), F-02 + F-42 (timeline legibility — shared chart wrapper: Week N label,
  rank-ordered tooltip, 12 distinct colors, de-noise).
- **Files likely touched:** `web/src/features/{teams,matchups,managers,players,draft,standings,
  stats,power}/`, the shared chart wrapper, the shared week-stepper; `api/routes/players.py` +
  schema for the F-24 contract change (gen:api drift).
- **Done when:** selectors/links work (incl. pre-2016); scope/has_scored gone; sort toggles; week
  selectable; draft board is a 12-col snake; timelines legible; typecheck+lint+vitest green;
  gen:api drift clean; click-through verified.

### P6 — Frontend: composition, seasonality & insight enhancements
- **Scope:** Re-curate views around season-aware modules and richer insights (the product's reason
  for existing).
- **Findings:** F-01 (home re-curation + season-phase signal), F-29 (player availability →
  insight module, off-season), F-08 (trophy case redesign), F-03 (standings extra insight), F-09
  (manager extra insight), F-18 (richer box-score breakdown), F-38 (draft-value drill-down + sort),
  F-21 (league-wide trophy case in records), F-41 (power: revise/expand methodology, keep the view;
  F-01 still drops power top-movers from home).
- **Files likely touched:** `web/src/features/{home,players,managers,records,draft,power,matchups,
  standings}/`; a shared **season-phase** helper (in-season vs off-season) consumed by F-01/F-29;
  small `analytics/` helpers where a new insight needs a metric.
- **Done when:** home/players/records re-curated and season-phase-aware; new insight modules land;
  power methodology improved + documented; gate green; click-through verified.

### UP — Upstream / Phase-1 program & research (NOT dashboard PRs)
- These are data-origin / research efforts outside the dashboard's read-only scope. Each should be
  its own program with its own plan; dashboard passes consume their outputs.
- **F-27 — Pre-2016 scoring reconstruction** (strategic north star). Discover each pre-2016 season's
  scoring settings by reconciling `player_stats_raw` against definitive nfl.com scores; log a
  per-season scoring-rules ledger; produce `player_stats_scored` for 2010–2015; self-validate. When
  it lands, F-16/F-22-player/F-26/F-39 collapse and the coverage page becomes largely obsolete.
- **F-25 — Roster→player match cleanup.** Automated, self-informing reconciliation of `team_rosters`
  → player identity (remove ghosts like A.B. Brown, fix mis-matches, audit the week-0 artifact).
  Likely mutates pipeline data → `ff_pipeline`, not the dashboard.
- **F-37 tier 2 — nfl.com transactions scrape.** Real transaction log (dates, waiver/FA/trade, FAAB
  bids), incl. the standard-order→FAAB switch.
- **F-06 — Ownership succession research.** Establish the team-line vs owner-tenure history; feeds a
  correct owner identity model.
- **F-49 — `is_consolation` unpopulated → `made_playoffs` not derivable (surfaced by fix-pass P1).**
  Phase-1 sets `Matchup.is_playoff=True` on **every** post-regular-season game (championship *and*
  consolation brackets) but never sets `is_consolation` (0 rows in the real DB; all 12 teams carry
  `is_playoff` games every season). The dashboard's F-10 `made_playoffs` derivation therefore can't
  distinguish a real playoff berth from a toilet-bowl game; it honestly returns `None` for any season
  whose bracket isn't a proper subset of the league (so most seasons read `None` today, a few older
  ones with a distinguishable bracket derive True/False). **UP fix:** populate `is_consolation` (and/or
  a per-season `playoff_teams` count) in `ff_pipeline` so the bracket is distinguishable; once it lands,
  `made_playoffs` becomes derivable league-wide with no dashboard change. The dashboard guard already
  consumes the better data automatically. (`result` is unaffected — it derives from `final_rank`.)
- **Foundation both sides need:** the **per-season league-settings ledger** (scoring rules, week
  structure, waiver system, ownership) — see the cross-cutting theme above. P1 builds the schedule
  slice config-driven; UP/F-27 builds the scoring slice; user supplies switch-years and ownership.
